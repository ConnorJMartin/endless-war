Being a huge, highly flammable balloon filled with hydrogen, it is the safest way to travel in the city only because it's out of the price range of most juveniles' budget. It's used by the rich elite to travel from their summer homes in Assault Flats Beach to their winter homes in Dreadford, and vice versa, without having to step foot in the more unsavory parts of the city. It does it's job well and only occasionally bursts into flames."
str_blimp_tower_description = "This mooring mast is mostly used for amassing millionaire mooks into the marvelous Neo Milwaukee multi-story zeppelin, m'lady. Basically, you can board a blimp here. All you have to do is walk up an extremely narrow spiral staircase without an adequate handrail for about 40 feet straight up and then you can embark onto the highest airship this side of the River of Slime! It'll be great! Don't mind the spontaneously combusting zeppelins crashing into the earth in the distance. That's normal."
str_downtown_station_description = "This large, imposing structure is the central hub for the entire city's rapid transit system. A public transportation powerhouse, it contains connections to every subway line in the city, and for dirt cheap. Inside of it's main terminal, a humongous split-flap display is constantly updating with the times of subway arrivals and departures. Hordes of commuters from all across the city sprint to their connecting trains, or simply spill out into the Downtown streets, ready to have their guts do the same.\n\nExits into Downtown NLACakaNM."
str_black_subway_description = "Black Line trains are strictly uniform, with dull, minimalistic furnishings producing a borderline depressing experience. Almost completely grey aside from it's style guide mandated black accents, everything is purely practical. It provides just enough for its commuting salarymen to get to work in the morning and home at night."
str_black_subway_station_description = "This sparsely decorated terminal replicates the feeling of riding on a Black Line train, otherwise known as inducing suicidal thoughts. Dim lighting barely illuminates the moldy, stained terminal walls. Inbound and outbound trains arrive and departure one after another with unreal temporal precision. You're not sure if you've ever seen a Black Line train be late. Still doesn't make you like being on one though."
str_green_subway_description = "Easily the oldest subway line in the city, with the interior design and general cleanliness to prove it. Once cutting edge, it's art deco stylings have begun to deteriorate due to overuse and underfunding. That goes double for the actual trains themselves, with a merely bumpy ride on the Green Line being the height of luxury compared to the far worse potential risks."
str_green_subway_station_description = "Much like its trains, Green Line terminals have fallen into disrepair. It's vintage aesthetic only exasperating it's crumbling infrastructure, making the whole line seem like a old, dilapidated mess. But, you'll give it one thing, it's pretty cool looking from the perspective of urban exploration. You've dreamed of exploring it's vast, abandoned subway networks ever since you first rode on it. They could lead to anywhere. So close, and yet so mysterious."
str_purple_subway_description = "Probably the nicest subway line in the city, the Purple Line isn't defined by its poor hygiene or mechanical condition. Instead, it's defined by its relative normality. More-or-less clean floors, brightly lit interiors, upholstery on the seats. These stunning, almost sci-fi levels of perfection are a sight to behold. Wow!"
str_purple_subway_station_description = "It is clean and well-kempt, just like the Purple Line trains. This relatively pristine subway terminal hosts all manner of unusualities. With limited amounts of graffiti sprayed unto the otherwise sort-of white walls, there's actually some semblance of visual simplicity. For once in this city, your eyes aren't being completely assaulted with information or blinding lights. Boring, this place sucks. Board whatever train you're getting on and get back to killing people as soon as possible."
str_pink_subway_description = "If there's one word to describe the Pink Line, it's \"confusing\". It's by far the filthiest subway line in the city, which is exponentially worsened by it's bizarre, unexplainable faux wood paneling that lines every train. You can only imagine that this design decision was made to make the subway feel less sterile and more homely, but the constant stench of piss and homeless people puking sort of ruins that idea. Riding the Pink Line makes you feel like you're at your grandma's house every single time you ride it, if your grandma's house was in Jaywalker Plain."
str_pink_subway_station_description = "It's absolutely fucking disgusting. By far the worst subway line, the Pink Line can't keep it's terrible interior design choices contained to its actual trains. Even in its terminals, the faux wood paneling clashes with every other aesthetic element present. It's ghastly ceilings have turned a delightful piss-soaked shade of faded white. It's bizarre mixture of homely decorations and completely dilapidated state makes you oddly beguiled in a way. How did they fuck up the Pink Line so bad? The world may never know."
str_gold_subway_description = "Construction started on the Gold Line in the 90’s, and it shows. It’s just so fucking gaudy. Opulent, even. It’s vaporwave gone wrong. Geometric patterns with clashing color combinations and art styles are plastered over every square inch of the walls, and the seats are made of that awful upholstery from old Taco Bell™ booths."
str_gold_subway_station_description = "The walls of the Gold Line are covered in terrible murals. Covered. Imagine your loaded in the level geometry of the station into Unity and then Googled “terrible street art murals” and skipped to page nine and then loaded each image as textures unto the geometry, not even accounting for when one object ended and another surface began. No one knows why it’s like this."

    "Then he went up from there to Bethel; and as he was going up by the way, young lads came out from the city and mocked him and said to him, “Go up, you baldhead; go up, you baldhead!” When he looked behind him and saw them, he cursed them in the name of the LORD.

You approach the Dojo Master with your plight, requesting his help to circumvent the legal issues of marrying your weapon. He takes a moment to unfurl his brow before letting out a raspy chuckle. He hasn’t been asked to do something like this for a long time, or so he says. You scroll up to the last instance of this flavor text and conclude he must have Alzheimer's or something. Regardless, he agrees.",
    "Departing from the main floor of the Dojo, he rounds a corner and disappears for a few minutes before returning with illegally doctor marriage paperwork and cartoonish blotches of ink on his face and hands to visually communicate the hard work he’s put into the forgeries. You see, this is a form of visual shorthand that artists utilize so they don’t have to explain every beat of their narrative explicitly, but I digress.",
    "You express your desire to get things done as soon as possible so that you can stop reading this boring wall of text and return to your busy agenda of murder, and so he prepares to officiate immediately. You stand next to your darling {weapon_name}, the only object of your affection in this godforsaken city. You shiver with anticipation for the most anticipated in-game event of your ENDLESS WAR career. A crowd of enemy and allied gangsters alike forms around you three as the Dojo Master begins the ceremony...",

All you have to do for freedom and protection is align yourself to one of the many GANG LEADERS that recruit poor, unfortunate juveniles like yourself. Too pussy to fight directly, they’ve resorted to brainwashed child soldiers to fight their proxy wars for them. Day after day, night after night, from dawn ‘till dusk and dusk ‘till dawn, these troubled youths fight without reason or purpose. Yes, it feels as though a presence pervades this city, from the most poverty-stricken slums to the most gentrified high rise apartments. It is the influence of ENDLESS WAR.\n\nNow get out of DMs and go to #detention-center, juvie. If you need help with ENDLESS WAR, try **!help** or **!commands** there.

help_responses = {
    # Introductions, part 1
    "gangs": "**Gang Violence** is the center focus of **Rowdy Fuckers Cop Killers' ENDLESS WAR**. Enlisting in a gang allows you to attack other gang members, juveniles, ghosts, and slime beasts with the **'!kill'** command. To enlist in a gang, use **'!enlist'**. However, a member of that gang must use **'!vouch'** for you beforehand in the same area as you. Enlisting will permanently affiliate you with that gang, unless you are !pardon'd by the **ROWDY FUCKER** (Munchy), the **COP KILLER** (Ben Saint), and the mods. You may use **'!renounce'** to return to the life of a juvenile, but you will lose half of your current slime, and you will still be affiliated with that gang, thus disallowing you from entering the enemy's gang base. Additionally, a Kingpin or administrator, should they feel the need to, can inflict the banishment status upon you, preventing you from enlisting in their gang.",
    "food": "Food lowers your hunger by a set amount, and can be ordered from various **restaurants** within the city. You can **'!menu'** to check the menu of any vendor currently in your POI. Generally speaking, the more expensive food is, the more hunger it sates. You can **'!order [food name] togo'** to order it togo, otherwise you will eat it on the spot, and you can **'!use [food name]'** to use it once its in your inventory. You can only carry a certain amount of food depending on your level. Regular food items expire after 2 in-game days by default, or 12 hours in real life, while crops expire after 8 in-game days (48 hours), and food items gained from milling expire after a whole 2 weeks in real life. Additionally, a lot of food from other vendors have varying expiry dates, as these resturants don't usually see many people ordering food to go. Three popular restauraunts close by various gang bases include **THE SPEAKEASY** (juveniles), **THE SMOKER'S COUGH** (rowdys), and **RED MOBSTER SEAFOOD** (killers), though there are other places to order food as well, such as the **Food Court**.",
    "capturing": "Capping is a battle for influence over the 33 districts of NLACakaNM, and one of your main goals as a gangster. Capped territories award your kingpin slime, and give your teammates benefits while visiting. You will automatically capture for your gang if you are enlisted and have more than 200,000 slime on you. Capturing creates influence for you, or decrease it for the enemy if they have influence there. Think of yourself mindlessly vandalizing the walls of the city wherever you go so long as you have the slime to do the deed. As you go, you can check your **!progress** to see how much influence you still need. It can be more or less depending on the territory class, running from rank C to S. \n\nA few more things to note:\n>You can't capture districts locked by surrounding captured districts, and that includes trying to top up progress of districts your own gang has locked in.\n>Don't attack enemy territory when it is surrounded by enemy territory/outskirts. Small little bitches like yourself are prone to fucking up severely under that much pressure.\n>The nightlife starts in the late night. Fewer cops are around to erase your handiwork, so if you cap then you will gain a 33% capping bonus.\n>Paint tools used to be fundamental with capturing, but you no longer need them even sidearmed, you can just keep your weapons out while you capture.",
    "transportation": "There are various methods of transportation within the city, the quickest and most efficient of them being **The Subway System**. Trains can be boarded with **'!board'** or **'!embark'**, and to board specific trains, you can add your destination to the command. For example, to board the red line to Cratersville, you would use '!board pinktocv'. **'!disembark'** can be used to exit a train. **The Ferry** (which moves between Vagrant's Corner and Wreckington) and **The Blimp** (which moves between Dreadford and Assault Flats Beach) can also be used as methods of transportation, though they take longer to arrive at their destinations than the trains do. Refer to the diagram below on understanding which districts and streets have subway stations in them.\nhttps://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/431237299137675297/1021140587572887653/slimemapfinal.png",
    "death": "**Death** is an integral mechanic to Endless War. Even the most experienced players will face the sewers every now and again. If you find yourself in such a situation, use **'!revive'** in the sewers channel, and you will return to the land of the living as a juvenile at the base of ENDLESS WAR. Dying will drop some of your unadorned cosmetics and food, and some of your unequiped weapons, but your currently adorned cosmetics and equiped weapon will remain in your inventory (Gangsters will lose half of their food/unadorned cosmetics, while Juveniles lose only a quarter). Alternatively, you can hold off on reviving and remain a **ghost**, which has its own gameplay mechanics associated with it. To learn more, use '!help ghosts' at one of the colleges or with a game guide, or see the wiki page here: https://rfck.miraheze.org/wiki/Ghosts",
    # Introductions, part 2
    "dojo": "**The Dojo** is where you acquire weapons to fight and kill other players with. To purchase a weapon, use **'!order [weapon]'**. There are many weapons you can choose from (you can view all of them with !menu), and they all perform differently from one another. Once you've purchased a weapon, you can use **'!equip [weapon]'** to equip it, provided that you're enlisted in a gang beforehand. You can also name your weapon by spending a poudrin on it with **'!annoint [name]'**. Furthermore, annointing will increase your mastery over that weapon, but it's much more inefficient to do so through **sparring**. To learn more about the sparring system and weapon ranks, use '!help sparring'.",
    "subzones": "**Subzones** are areas locations within the districts of the city where gang violence off-limits, with the only exception being the subway stations, the trains, the Black Pond, Drain Trench, the Soda Fountain, and the Slime's End Cliffs. If you don't type anything in a sub-zone for 60 minutes, you'll get kicked out for loitering, so be sure to check up often if you don't wanna get booted out into the streets.",
    "scouting": "Scouting is a way for you to check how many **players** might be in a district that's close by. You can do just **'!scout'** to check the district you're already in, or **'!scout [district]'** to scout out that specific district. For example, if you were in Vagrant's Corner, you could use '!scout gld' to see how many players might be in Green Light District. Scouting will show both **friendly and enemy** gang members, as well as juveniles and even enemies. Scouting will list all players/enemies above your own level, as well as players/enemies below your level, but at a certain **cutoff point**. If you can't scout someone, it's safe to assume they have around **1/10th** the amount of slime that you do, or less. It should be noted that scouting currently only gives an estimate, sending off different messages depending on how many players are in that district.",
    "wanted": "If you find that you have a role with 'Wanted' in the name, be alarmed. This means that you are able to be attacked by gangsters! Always be on the look out and remember to check your corners.",
    "combat": "Once you have enlisted in a gang, you can engage in gang violence. To do so you will need a weapon, which you can find at the Dojo and a target. To attack an enemy, you have to **!equip** a weapon and **!kill [player]**. Attacking costs slime, and the default cost for attacking is ((your slime level)^4 / 60), and the default damage it does to your opponent is ((your slimelevel)^4 / 6). Every weapon has an attack cost mod and a damage mod that may change these default values. When you reduce a player's slime count below 0 with your attacks, they die. Some weapons will ask you to input a security code with every attack. This security code, also referred to as a captcha, is displayed after a previous !kill or when you !inspect your weapon. There are many different types of weapons, so make sure to consult the guide to learn more about your current weapon.",
    # Ways to gain slime
    "mining": "Mining is the primary way to gain slime in **ENDLESS WAR**. When you type !mine, you'll get some slime and get slightly hungry. The more slime you mine for, the higher your level gets. Mining will sometimes endow you with hardened crystals of slime called **Slime Poudrins**, which can be used for farming and annointing your weapon. **JUVENILES** can mine any time they like, but **ROWDYS** and **KILLERS** are restricted to mining during the day (8AM-6PM) and night (8PM-6AM), respectively. If you are enlisted, you can make use of the **pickaxe**, which increases the amount of slime you gain from mining. Random events will happen while you mine, like simple slime-boosts, guaranteed poudrins for a certain time, unearthing skeletons and ghosts, cave-ins, and sometimes just finding a bottomless pit to throw yourself down into. Similarly to clicker games your base action is **!mine**, however some mines can dynamically change how mining works. Basic instructions for these variations can be found in those mines.",
    "scavenging": "Scavenging allows you to collect slime that is **stored** in districts. When someone in a district gets hurt or dies, their slime **splatters** onto the ground, allowing you to use **'!scavenge'** and collect it, similarly to mining. Scavenging raises your hunger by 1% with every command entered. If you type **!scavenge** by itself, you will be given a captca to type. The more captchas you type correctly, the more slime you will gain. To check how much slime you can scavenge, use **'!look'** while in a district channel. You can also scavenge for items by doing '!scavenge [item name]'.",
    "farming": "**Farming** is an alternative way to gain slime, accessible only by **JUVENILES**. It is done by planting poudrins on a farm with the **'!sow'** command. You can only '!sow' one poudrin per farm. After about 12 in-game hours (3 hours in real life), you can use **'!reap'** to gain 200,000 slime, with a 1/30 chance to gain a poudrin. If you do gain a poudrin, you also have 1/3 chance to gain a second poudrin. If your poudrin plant is left alone for too long (around 2 in-game days, or 12 hours in real life), it will **die out**. In addition to slime, farming also provides you with various **crops** which can be used for **milling**, but you can also **'!crush'** them to gain cosmetic materials for smelting random cosmetics. Crops can be eaten by themselves, but it's much more useful if you use **'!mill'** on them while at a farm, granting you crop materials used for smelting **dyes**, as well as food items and cosmetics associated with that crop by doing '!mill'. Dyes can be used on slimeoids with **'!saturateslimeoid'**. Crops can also be sown themselves with '!sow [crop name]', and upon reaping you be rewarded with a bushel of that crop, as well as 100,000 slime. You can, however, increase the slime gained from sowing crops by using **'!checkfarm'**, and performing **'!irrigate'**, **'!fertilize'**, **'!pesticide'** or **'!weed'** if neccessary. Current farms within the city include **JUVIE'S ROW FARMS** (within Juvie's Row), **OOZE GARDENS FARMS** (close by Rowdy Roughhouse), and **ARSONBROOK FARMS** (close by Cop Killtown).",
    "fishing": "**Fishing** can be done by performing the **'!cast'** command at one of the six piers, including **Juvie's Row Pier**, **Crookline Pier**, **Jaywalker Plain Pier**, **Toxington Pier**, **Assault Flats Beach Pier**, **Slime's End Pier**, as well as **The Ferry**. To reel in a fish, use **'!reel'** when the game tells you that you have a bite. If you don't reel in quick enough, the fish will get away. If you have the **fishing rod** equiped, you will have increased chances of reeling in a fish. For more information about fishing, refer to this out of date, but charming guide (credits to Miller#2705).\n<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHDeSukIqME>\nAs an addendum to that video, note that fish can be taken to the labs in Brawlden, where they can be made more valuble in bartering by increasing their size with **'!embiggen [fish]'**.",
    "hunting": "**Hunting** is another way to gain slime in ENDLESS WAR. To hunt, you can visit **The Outskirts**, which are layered areas located next to the edge of the map (Wreckington/Cratersville/Ooze Gardens -> South Outskirts Edge -> South Outskirts -> South Outskirts Depths, etc). In the outskirts, you will find enemies that you can !kill. Rather than doing '!kill @' like with players, with enemies you can either type their display name ('!kill Dinoslime'), their shorthand name ('!kill dino'), or their identifying letter ('!kill A'), which can be accessed with !look or !survey (WARNING: Raid bosses moving around the city do not have identifying letters. You must use the other targeting methods to attack them). To see how much slime an enemy has, you can do '!data [enemy name]', or just !data with any of the previous types of methods listed. Enemies will drop items and slime upon death, and some enemies are more powerful and threatening than others. In fact, there are enemies powerful enough to hold their own against the gangsters in the city, called **Raid Bosses**, and will enter into the city as a result, rather than just staying in the outskirts like regular enemies. **The Rowdy Roughhouse** and **Cop Killtown** will send out a response that mentions which district a raid boss has entered into. Enemies despawn after **3 hours in real life**.",
    # Additional gameplay mechanics, part 1
    "mutations": "**Mutations** are helpful bonuses you acquire when you level up. The more powerful your next mutation, the more level ups it takes to acquire. This is represented my the mutation's level. When you acquire a mutation, a short text response will indicate what it can do. To modify your mutations, you need to go to NLACakaNM Clinic of Slimoplasty in Crookline. When you get there, you can !chemo <mutation> to remove a mutation you acquired, or !chemo all to remove all possible mutations from your body. You can use !graft <mutation> to add a mutation to yourself. Keep in mind that you cannot use !chemo on a mutation if you got it through grafting, and you can only !graft a mutation if you have enough space in your mutations pool. You will likely need to !chemo a mutation out in order to !graft something else.",
    "mymutations": "You read some research notes about your current mutations...",  # will print out a list of mutations with their specific mechanics
    "smelting": "Smelting is a way for you to craft certain items from certain ingredients. To smelt, you use **'!smelt [item name]'**, which will either smelt you the item, or tell which items you need to smelt the item. Popular items gained from smelting are **Cosmetics**, as well as the coveted **Pickaxe** and **Super Fishing Rod**. If you're stuck, you can look up the crafting recipes for any item with **!whatcanimake [itemname] or its shortcommand !wcim [itemname]**.",
    "sparring": "**Sparring** can be done between two players using **'!spar [player]'**. Sparring, provided that both players spar with the same weapon type and are not at full hunger, will increase both of your **MASTERY** by one. The publicly displayed value, mastery **RANK** (which is just 4 ROOKIE levels and then 6 MASTERY levels, totalling in rank 10 when at mastery 6.), is more important. It should be noted that the damage you deal with your weapon is increased even if you haven't reached rank 1 yet. However, once you do reach at least mastery rank 2 (Again, this would be level 6), when you next revive, you will now **permanently** be at level 6 for that weapon type until you annoint or spar again. Essentially, this means you will always start back at rank 2. Once you reach **rank 6**, you can no longer annoint your weapon rank any higher, and must instead kill other players/enemies (that are higher in both slime and level than you) to do so. Reaching rank 6 also stops you from increasing your own rank through sparring, unless you are sparring with someone who has a higher weapon rank than you. You can only spar up to someone else's mastery rank, minus 1 (example: Sparring with a rank 15 master of the katana would, at most, allow you to get to rank 14). Sparring has a one minute cooldown and raises your hunger by about 5%. Once you reach rank 8, you may also **'!marry'** your weapon, resulting in a matrimonial ceremony that increases your rank by two.",
    "ghosts": "Ghost gameplay revolves around the acquisition of antislime, through haunting and possession. Every use of **'!haunt'** away a small portion of slime from the haunted player, and grants it to the ghost as antislime. The amount of slime taken starts at 1/1000th and varies depending on a number of conditions, and you may also add a customized message by doing '!haunt [@player] [message]'. It can be done face-to-face like with !kill, or done remotely with decreased potency. As a ghost, you can only leave the sewers after being dead for at least a day. Furthermore, if a player has consumed **coleslaw**, they can **'!bust'** ghosts, which sends them back to the sewers. After amassing sufficient **Negative Slime** ghosts can conjure **Negaslimoids** at Waffle House. Ghosts can also **!inhabit** living players to move alongside them. If a ghost has sufficient antislime, they may also **!possessweapon** or **!possessfishingrod** to grant bonuses to the player they're inhabiting, with a potential reward in antislime if conditions are fulfilled. For more detailed information on ghost mechanics, see https://rfck.miraheze.org/wiki/Ghosts",
    # Additional gameplay mechanics, part 2
    "slimeoids": "**SLIMEOIDS** are sentient masses of slime that you can keep as **pets**. To learn how to make one for yourself, visit **The Slimeoid Laboratory** in Brawlden and check the enclosed **'!instructions'**. After you've made one, you can also battle it out with other slimeoids in **The Arena**, located in Vandal Park. Slimeoids can also be used to fight **Negaslimeoids** that have been conjured by ghosts. If your slimeoid dies, it's **HEART** is dropped, which can be sown in the ground like a poudrin, or taken to the labs to revive your slimeoid with **'!restoreslimeoid'**. In regards to your slimeoid's stats, a slimeoid's **'Moxie'** represents its physical attack, **'Chutzpah'** its special attack, and **'Grit'** its defense. Additionally, the color you dye your slimeoid with **'!saturateslimeoid'** also plays into combat. Your slimeoid gets attack bonuses against slimeoids that have its split complementary hue and resist slimeoids with its analgous hues. For more information, see the diagrams linked below (credits to Slimepunk#3355). There are also various commands you can perform on your slimeoid, such as **'!observeslimeoid'**, **'!petslimeoid'**, **'!walkslimeoid'**, and **'!playfetch'**. To humanely and ethically euthanize your slimeoid, use **'!dissolveslimeoid'** at the laboratory. To store and release your slimeoid in a bottle (Warning: This bottle is dropped upon death!!), use **'!bottleslimeoid'** and **'!unbottleslimeoid [slimeoid]'**, respectively. To add a description to your slimeoid, use **!tagslimeoid** with a dog tag. To remove this description, **!untagslimeoid**. To battle to the **DEATH**, use **'slimeoidbattle [@] todeath'**.\n<https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/492088204053184533/586310921274523648/SLIMEOID-HUE.png>\n<https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/177891183173959680/586662087653064706/SLIMEOID-HUE.gif>\n<https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/177891183173959680/586662095848996894/SLIMEOID_HUE_NOTE.png>",
    "cosmetics": "**Cosmetics** are items that the player may wear. To equip and un-equip a cosmetic, use **'!adorn [cosmetic]'** and **'!dedorn [cosmetic]'**. If you have four slime poudrins and a cosmetic material, you can use **'!smelt'** to create a random one from scratch. These cosmetic materials can be obtained from using **'!crush'** on vegetables gained by farming with the exception of Evil Studs, which is gained from sowing player scalps instead. Cosmetics can either be of 'plebeian', 'patrician', or 'profollean' quality, indicating their rarity. If you win an art contest held for the community, a Kingpin will make a **Princep** cosmetic for you, which is custom tailored, and will not leave your inventory upon death. Cosmetics can be dyed with **!dyecosmetic [cosmetic name/id] [dye name/id]**. To check which cosmetics you have adorned, you can use !fashion.",
    "realestate": "The **Real Estate Agency** is, well, the agency where you buy real estate. First, check out the property you want with **'!consult [district]'**. The real estate agent will tell you a bit about the area. \nOnce you've made your decision, you can **'!signlease [district]'** to seal the deal. There's a down payment, and you will be charged rent every 2 IRL days. Fair warning, though, if you already have an apartment and you rent a second one, you will be moved out of the first.\n\nFinally, if you own an apartment already, you can **'!aptupgrade'** it, improving its storage capabilities, but you'll be charged a huge down payment and your rent will double. The biggest upgrade stores 32 closet items, 32 food items, 96 shelved items, and 24 pieces of furniture (And can be doubled if you have mutation Packrat). And if you're ready to cut and run, use **'!breaklease'** to end your contract. It'll cost another down payment, though.\n\nYou can !addkey to acquire a housekey. Giving this item to some lucky fellow gives them access to your apartment, including all your prized posessions. Getting burglarized? Use !changelocks to eliminate all housekeys you created. Both cost a premium, though.",
    "apartments": "Once you've gotten yourself an apartment, there are a variety of things you can do inside it. To enter your apartment, do **'!retire'** in the district your apartment is located in. Alternatively, you can **'!goto apt'**. To change the name and description of your apartment, do **'!aptname [name]'** and **'!aptdesc [description]'**, respectively. To place and remove furniture (purchasable in The Bazaar and elsewhere), do **'!decorate [furniture]'** and **'!undecorate [furniture]'**. You can store and remove items with **'!stow'** and **'!snag'**, which will store them in either the Fridge (for food items), the Bookshelf (for zines), or the Closet. Each of these can store a certain amount of their respective items, which can be viewed with **'!fridge'**, **'!shelf'**, and **'!closet'**. You can also check the capacity of your apartment and any decorated collections with **'!decorate'** standalone. To store and remove your slimeoid or negaslimeoid, do **'!freeze'** and **'!unfreeze'**. \n\nFor information on collection functionality, use **'!help collections'**.\n\nTo enter someone else's apartment, you can do **'!knock [player]'**, which will prompt them to let you in.",
    "stocks": "**The Stock Exchange** is a sub-zone within downtown NLACakaNM, open only during the daytime (6AM-8PM). It allows players to **'!invest'** in various **'!stocks'**, which not only affects their own personal monetary gains, but the city's economy as well. Stocks will shift up and down value, which affects the price of food associated with the food chains of those respective stocks. The rate of exchange for stocks can be checked with **'!rates'**, and to withdraw your **'!shares'** from a stock, use **'!withdraw [amount] [stock]'** (the same logic also applies to !invest). Additionally, players may **'!transfer'** their slimecoin to other players at any time of the day while in the stock exchange, but at the cost of a 5% broker's fee and a 5 minute cooldown on subsequent transfers.",
    # Additional gameplay mechanics, part 3
    "trading": "Trading allows you to exchange multiple items at once with another player. You can ask someone to trade with you by using **!trade [player]**. Should they accept, you will be able to offer items with **!offer [item]**. Use **!removeoffer [item]** to remove an item from your offers. You can check both player's offers by using **!trade** again. When you're ready to finish the trade, use **!completetrade**. The items will only be exchanged when both players do the command. Note that if a player adds or removes an item afterwards you will no longer be set as ready and will need to redo the command. Should you want to cancel the trade, you can do so by using **!canceltrade**.",
    "weather": "Like most cities, NLACakaNM has a vibrant weather cycle. There are 7 major weather types within NLACakaNM: **sunny**, **rainy**, **windy**, **cloudy**, **foggy**, **snow**, and **lightning**. The weather primarily activates certain mutation-based buffs, as well as changing what fish are available within the city's water sources. To check the current weather, use **'!weather'**. To check the forecast, use **'!forecast [long/short]'**. \n\nYou may also notice the **moon phase**, which depends on a 29-day cycle. There's 7 major phases: the **new moon**, the **waxing horns**, the **waxing mandibles**, the **crescent moon**, the **waning maw**, the **waning sliver**, and the uncommon **green moon**. \n\nNLACakaNM is also faced with many **Natural Disasters**. These will affect one district in particular for a specific amount of time, and be visible from '!weather' and announced within gangbases. Though varying in their natural-ness, the current disasters facing NLACakaNM include **tornadoes**, **meteor showers**, **smog warnings**, **poudrin hail**, **radiation storms**, **japestorms**, **firestorms**, **raider incursions**, **slimeunist protests**, **dimensional rifts**, **fishing frenzies**, and **gas leaks**. \n\n**Tornadoes** will launch you out of an affected district (unless you have Big Boned), **Meteor Showers** will light up the night sky, **Smog Warnings** will make you unable to !scout that district, **Poudrin Hail** will crush you if you stand around too long without an umbrella, **Radiation Storms** will cuase you to generate slime while standing in the district (while also attracting radioactive creatures), **Japestorms** will cause all manner of laughery, **Firestorms** will set anyone without Napalm Snot ablaze, **Raider Incursions** will see raiders invade the district, **Slimeunist Protests** will see protesters fill the streets, **Dimensional Rifts** will open rifts between districts, **Fishing Frenzies** will cause fish to bite 2x as fast, and **Gas Leaks** will lessen hunger penalty from mining.",
    "casino": "**The Casino** is a sub-zone in Green Light District where players may bet their slime and slimecoin in various games, including **'!slimepachinko'**, **'!slimecraps'**, **'!slimeslots'**, **'!slimeroulette'**, **'!slimebaccarat'**, and **!slimeskat**. Some games allow you to bet certain amounts, while other games have a fixed cost. Furthermore, the casino allows you to challenge other players to a game of **'!russianroulette'**, where most of the loser's slime is transferred to the winner. To bet with slime, simply add 'slime' to the name of the game you wish to play. Example: **!slimeslots 500 slime**. You can gamble through your gellphone, but only with slimecoin.",
    "bleeding": "When you get hit by someone using a '!kill' command, certain things happen to your slime. Let's say you take 20,000 points of damage. **50%** of that slime, in this case 10,000, immediately becomes scavengeable. However, the other 50%, provided that you didn't die instantly, will undergo the **bleeding** process. 25% of that slime, in this case 5,000, is immediately added to a 'bleed pool', causing it to slowly trickle out of your body and onto the ground for it to be scavenged. The remaining 25% of that slime will **slowly** be added to the 'bleed pool', where it will then bleed, just as previously stated. Upon dying, your 'bleed pool' is immediately dumped onto the ground, ready to be scavenged. Think of it like the 'rolling HP' system from the game *EarthBound*. When you get hit, you don't take all your damage upfront, it instead slowly trickles down.",
    "offline": "Given that ENDLESS WAR is a **Discord** game, there are a few peculiarities surrounding it and how it interacts with Discord itself. When you set your status to **'Offline'**, you can still move between districts if you typed a '!goto' command beforehand. You won't show up on the sidebar in that district's channel, but people can still scout for you, and see the '[player] has entered [district]' message when you do enter the district they're in. Furthermore, you **can't** use commands while offline, and can only use commands **5 seconds** after coming online again. Often times, you may find yourself using '!scout' or '!look' on a district, only to find that **no one** is there besides yourself. This is likely because they're in that district, just with their status set to offline. The exception to this, of course, is if you have the **Chameleon Skin** mutation, which lets you type a handful of commands even while offline, including **!goto**, **!look**, **!scout**, **!survey**, **!embark**, and **!disembark**.",
    # Additional gameplay mechanics, part 4
    "profile": "This isn't so much a guide on gameplay mechanics as it is just a guide for what to expect from roleplaying in ENDLESS WAR. The general rule of thumb is that your profile picture will act as your 'persona' that gets depicted in fanworks, and it can be said that many of the colorful characters you'll find in NLCakaNM originated in this way.",
    "manuscripts": "First of all, to start a manuscript, you're gonna need to head down to the Cafe, either University, or the Comic Shop.\n\nYou can **!beginmanuscript [title]** at the cost of 20k slime.\n\nIf you happen to regret your choice of title, you can just **!settitle [new title]**.\n\nThe author name is already set to your nickname, but if you want to change it, you change your nickname and then **!setpenname**.\n\nYou're required to specify a genre for your future zine by using **!setgenre [genre name]** (Genre list includes: narrative, historical, comic, ||porn||, instructional, lore, reference, journal, newspaper, and experimental).\n\nIf at any time you would like to look at the title, author name, and length of your manuscript, then use **!manuscript**.\n\n*NOW*, if you actually want to start getting stuff done, you're gonna need to **!editpage [page number] [content]**. Every zine has 10 pages (kinda) that you can work with, but you can **!setpages [pages]** to customize it (maximum is 20, minimum is 5). Each holds a maximum of 1500 characters of content. You can fill it with information, image links, smut, whatever floats your freakish boat. If you try to edit a page that already has writing, it will ask you to confirm the change before overwriting it.\n\nYou can also set a cover, which is optional. You do this with **!editpage cover [image link]**.\n\nTo check any of your pages, simply **!viewpage [number]** to see how it looks.\n\nKeep in mind that manuscripts ARE NOT items and can't be lost on death. They're accessible from any authoring location (Cafe, NLACU, NMS, Comics). A player can only have 1 manuscript out at a time.\n\nOnce you are completely finished, you can **!publish** your manuscript (it will ask you to confirm that you are completely done with it), which will enable the citizens of the town to purchase it from any zine place. From there, it will be bought and rated by the people and you may even earn some royalty poudrins for it.",
    "zines": "**Zines** are the hot new trend in Neo-Milwaukee and give slimebois of all shapes and sizes access to the free-market of information and culture.\n\nTo obtain a zine, you must head down to any of these locations: Green Cake Cafe, NLAC University, Neo-Milwaukee State, or Glockbury Comics.\n\nFrom there, you can **!browse** for zines. They are ordered by *Zine ID*, but you have many options for sorting them, including: **title, author, datepublished,** any of the genres (including **narrative, historical, comic, ||porn||, instructional, lore, reference, journal, newspaper,** and **experimental**.), **length, sales,** and **rating** (use **!browse [criteria]**). You can also add **reverse** on to any of these in order to make it display in reverse order. Example: **!browse bestsellers reverse** (essentially looks for worse-selling zines). Browsing in the Comic Shop will automatically browse for comic zines and browsing at the Colleges will look for historical zines (keep in mind that any zines can be bought from these places).\n\nYou can also **!browse [Zine ID]** in order to get info about that specific zine, including sales, length, genre, and rating.\n\nOnce you've found a zine that's caught your eye, simply **!orderzine [Zine ID]** to buy it for 10k slime.\n\nAfter absorbing the zine's content, it is your moral obligation as a reader to **!review [Zine Name] [Score]**. The potential scores range from between 1 and 5 *fucks* (whole numbers only). If you hate a zine, then give it one fuck. If you absolutely loved it, give it five fucks. Simple. By the way, if a zine's average rating is less than 2.0 by the time it gets to 10 ratings (or less than 1.5 by 5 ratings), it will be excluded from the default browse. The only way to purchase it will be to use the **worstrated** or **all** sorting methods.\n\nYou can **!shelve [zine name]** in your apartment after you've finished.",
    # "sap": "**Sap** is a resource your body produces to control your slime. It's integral to being able to act in combat. You can have a maximum amount of sap equal to 1.6 * ( your slime level ^ 0.75 ). When you spend it, it will regenerate at a rate of 1 sap every 5 seconds. You can spend your sap in a variety of ways: **!harden [number]** allows you to dedicate a variable amount of sap to your defense. Hardened sap reduces incoming damage by a factor of 10 / (10 + hardened sap). Your hardened sap counts against your maximum sap pool, so the more you dedicate to defense, the less you will have to attack. You can **!liquefy [number]** hardened sap back into your sap pool. Every attack requires at least 1 sap to complete. Different weapons have different sap costs. Some weapons have the ability to destroy an amount of hardened sap from your target, or ignore a portion of their hardened sap armor. This is referred to as **sap crushing** and **sap piercing** respectively. There are also other actions you can take in combat, that cost sap, such as: **!aim [player]** will slightly increase your hit chance and crit chance against that player for 10 seconds. It costs 2 sap. **!dodge [player]** will decrease that players hit chance against you for 10 seconds. It costs 3 sap. **!taunt [player]** will decrease that player's hit chance against targets other than you for 10 seconds. It costs 5 sap.",

    "burying": "**Burying** is a mechanic that allows one to store an item within a location secretly, only retrievable through a password linked to the item.\n\nTo put an item in the ground, you first must !equip a **shovel**, sold at Atomic Forest Stockpile in the Ooze Gardens Farms. Once equipped, you can **!bury [coordinates] [item]**. The coordinates can be any string you enter, and will be saved with no spaces, punctuation, or case. For example, entering \"!bury DustTrap poudrin\" while in Cratersville will result in a slime poudrin being buried in Cratersville with the coordinates \"DUSTTRAP\". Once you bury an item, the message sent by ENDLESS WAR indicating the correct coordinates of the item will disappear after a short time. Make sure you write the coordinates elsewhere, as **once buried, an item cannot be recovered without the correct coordinates**.\n\nTo **!unearth** an item, simply go to the location it was buried in and type **!unearth [coordinates]**. You do **not need a shovel** to !unearth buried items, just the location and coordinates. Be aware anyone can !unearth buried items, not just the player who buried them, and so this can be utilized as if a sort of dead drop. Finally, if multiple items are buried in the same location with the same coordinates, you must !unearth [coordinates] multiple times to unearth all of the items.\n\nHappy burying!", 
    "stats": "Within ENDLESS WAR, **Stats** are a mechanic that allow the player to showcase their skill in specific areas. You can gain XP through your actions in-game, and you'll level-up as you accrue more and more XP. There are currently 4 stats: mining, farming, fishing, and feasting. To check your stats, use **!stats**. To check now-unobtainable stats, or to check all stats, use **!stats hidden** or **!stats all** respectively. Keep in mind, stats currently have **no effect**, and a player with Level 99 mining will function identical to a player with Level 1 mining. \n\nStat List:\n**MINING** - Mining XP is gained through !mining within mines, with the amount of XP gained being based on the amount of slime mined. \n**FARMING** - Farming XP is gained through !reaping mature crops, with the amount of XP gained being based on both number of crops gained and amount of slime gained. \n**FISHING** - Fishing XP is gained through !reeling up fish or items, with the amount of XP gained being based upon the rarity of the !reel. \n**FEASTING** - Feasting XP is gained through !eating or !ordering food, with the amount of XP gained being based upon the hunger restoration of the food.",
    "collections": "**Collections** are furniture items that can store other items within them. You can buy different types of collections at the Museum: **scalp collections** that can hold scalps, **large aquariums** that can hold fish, **soul cylinders** that can hold souls, **weapon chests** that can hold weapons, **portable greenhouses** that can hold crops, and **general collections** that can hold anything. Specialized collections can store **50** of a specific type of item, and have **unique flavor text upon '!inspect'ing**. General collections can store **10** of any non-collection item and do not unique flavor text. Placing a collection in your apartment will give it its own named line in '!look' text.\n\nOnce you have a collection, while in your apartment, you can **'!collect <collection> <item>'** to store an item in the collection. If you have the mutation **Packrat**, you can !collect into any collection in your inventory while outside your apartment. To remove an item from a collection, go to the Bazaar, and you can **'!extract <collection> <item>'** for **100,000 slime** (greenhouses only cost **1,000 slime**). You can rename collections while in your apartment with **'!renamecollection <collection> [name]'**. Once a collection is placed, you can **'!inspect <collection>'** to view its contents and any accompanying flavor text or information. General collections will have an italicized name on upon '!look', as to distinguish that they do not have any accompanying flavor text or information. Finally, with **'!contents <collection>'**, you can view a collection as if it were a community chest.",

    # Weapon Types
    "normal": "**Normal weapons** include the **Dual Pistols**, **Revolver**, **Yo-yo**, **Pistol**, and **Combat Knife**. These are straightforward weapons with no gimmicks and average damage.",
    "multiple-hit": "**Multiple hit weapons** include the **SMG**, **Assault Rifle**, **Nunchucks**, and **Boomerang**. They deal three weak attacks per kill command, and are very safe reliable weapons, though they deal slightly below average damage on average.",
    "variable-damage": "**Variable damage weapons** include the **Nailbat**, **Bass**, **Brass Knuckles**, **Bass Guitar**, **Skateboard**, and **Machete**. On average, these weapons deal pretty good damage for a very reasonable attack cost, but their unreliability can make them quite risky to use.",
    "small-game": "**Small game weapons** include the **Knives**, **Minecraft Bow**, and **Monofilament Whip**. These are reliable and underpowered weapons, with extremely low usage costs making them very efficient. Best used for bullying weaklings and hunting.",
    "heavy": "**Heavy weapons** include the **Scythe**, **Shotgun**, **Broadsword**, **Chainsaw**, and **Sledgehammer**. Unreliable and incredibly expensive to use, to compensate for their very high damage.",
    "defensive": "**Defensive weapons** currently only include the **Umbrella**. While you have one equipped, you take 25% reduced damage! Best used for punching down or protecting yourself while traveling, these weapons are typically too weak and unwieldy for use in normal combat scenarios. Always has a captcha length of 4.",
    "precision": "**Precision weapons** include the **Katana**, **Hunting Rifle**, and **Sniper Rifle**. They always hit, and get a guaranteed crit if you have no other weapons equipped. These weapons deal very high and reliable damage, but only if you're willing to bear the burden of their captcha and the lack of flexibility they impose. Always has a captcha length of 4.",
    "incendiary": "**Incendiary weapons** include the **Molotov Bottles** and the **Dragon Claw**. You will take 10% to 15% of your slime as damage if you enter the captcha wrong! They also deal an extra 50% damage to the target and any flagged enemies in the area over time, causing them to explode on death. A more powerful alternative to explosive weapons, if you can deal with the damage being dealt over time, rather than on one go. Usually has a captcha length of 4. \n\nThis is **OUT OF DATE**.",
    "explosive": "**Explosive weapons** currently only include the **Grenades**. You will take 10% to 15% of your slime as damage if you enter the captcha wrong!

Usually has a captcha length of 4.",
    "tool": "**Tools** include the **Pickaxe**, **Diamond Pickaxe**, **Hoe**, **Pitchfork**, **Shovel**, and **Fishing Rod**. They can provide bonuses outside of combat while equipped. Unlike other weapons, Fishing Rods, Hoes, Pitchforks, and Shovels can be equipped by Juvies, although juvies still cannot !kill. When tools are used in combat, they function identically to a normal weapon, but deal 45.4% as much damage.",
    "unique": "**Unique weapons** include the **Minigun**, **Garrote Wire**, **Eldritch Staff**, **Slimeoid Whistle**, and **Missile Launcher**. These have unique, non-standard damage properties and effects specified with the weapon, and act as specialty options for combat.",

In the past these had unique effects or functionality, but due to features being reworked or removed, nowadays act as tools without outside-of-combat function.",
    "other": "**Other weapons** include **Fingernails**, the **Laywaster**, **Harpoon**, **ModeL 397**, and **Fists**. These are either equippable through means other than an item, or limited-edition weapons with either 1 in existence or being unobtainable through traditionally-legitimate means.",

    weapon_id_revolver: "**The revolver** is a normal weapon for sale at Coalition Surplus. It's an ordinary six-shot revolver, so you'll have to **!reload** it after attacking six times, though its attack cost is reduced to 80% to compensate. Goes well with a cowboy hat.",

    mutation_id_bingeeater: "Upon eating food, the restored hunger is multiplied by the number of dishes you’ve consumed in the past 5 seconds. Eating lots of food at once puts you in a raging food coma, increasing defense.",

    mutation_id_dressedtokill: "50% more damage if freshness is at least 250.",
    mutation_id_keensmell: "Scouting will list off the names of players and enemies within a district. Will not work on players with the Aposematic Stench or Three's A Shroud mutations.",
    mutation_id_enlargedbladder: "You can use the !piss command. The most cost-effective mutation, and therefore the best one.",

    mutation_id_trashmouth: "Reach maximum power scavenges 3 times as fast. Example: The soft cooldown of 15 seconds on scavenging is now reduced to 5 seconds. You can also eat cosmetics and furniture. You can also eat furniture and cosmetics using !devour <item>.",
    mutation_id_webbedfeet: "Your scavenging power increases the more slime there is in a district. Caps out at 400% more slime gained from scavenging, but does stack with the White Nationalist mutation. You can feel out the amount of slime you scavenge.",

    mutation_id_dyslexia: "The size of captchas is decreased by 1 character. If a captcha is 1, the captcha length will stay the same.",

    mutation_id_rigormortis: "You are able to !preserve up to 5 items. These items will not drop when you are killed. You must have this mutation for the preservation to take effect, and the items must be in your inventory.",
    mutation_id_nervesofsteel: " Use !brace to freeze movement, preventing outgoing and incoming damage for 20 seconds. As a juvie, you can play Russian Roulette and commit suicide.",
    mutation_id_napalmsnot: "You do some burn damage when attacking with any weapon, in addition to its normal damage. You also gain immunity to burn damage.",
    mutation_id_ditchslap: "Use !slap @user <location> on an ally to instantly launch them to an adjacent district. If you are in a safe zone, the target must use !clench before they can be hit. Any given ally can't be slapped again for a 5 minute cooldown.",

    mutation_id_onemansjunk: "When bartering fish with Alexander, you will only receive offers for items, not slime",
    mutation_id_oneeyeopen: "Use !track @user to keep your eye on a specific player. If they move to a PVP zone, you will receive  a DM. If you are being tracked, you can !shakeoff @user to remove their tracking. To check who you're currently tracking, use !thirdeye.",
    mutation_id_bottomlessappetite: "Your maximum hunger is doubled.",
    mutation_id_airlock: "Combined weather effects of all weather-based mutations. This mutation is mutually exclusive with those.",
    mutation_id_ambidextrous: "If you are unarmed or have a tool equipped, and have a weapon in your sidearm slot, you will default to that weapon. Any weapon that you have mastery 7 or higher with will not be dropped on death.",

    mutation_id_landlocked: "When standing in a street either bordering an outskirt or the Slime Sea, use !loop to warp to the opposite side of the map. This also works on the ferry and at Slime's End Cliffs. There is a 60 second travel time when using !loop.",

    mutation_id_gay: "You're gay.",

consult_responses = {
    "downtown": "Our complex in Downtown is a sight to behold, one of our most in-demand properties. The whole complex is 2-story penthouses, with built-in storage facility/fallout shelter, restaurant sized fridge, and state-of-the-art bulletproof windows. This is an offer you won't want to pass up, believe you me. Now, perhaps you're concerned about the large amount of gang violence in the area. But, uh...shut up. ",
    "smogsburg": "Have you ever wanted wake up to a haze outside your window every morning? Or to fall asleep to the sound of bazaar merchants bickering with one another in foreign languages? I do, too! That's why I live in Smogsburg, where the prices are low and the furniture is close! Seriously, because of how nearby it is to the bazaar, I've been sniping amazing deals on high quality furniture. Wait...why are you looking at me like that? Actually on second thought, don't buy a property here. I don't want you to steal my shit.",
    "krakbay": "Krak Bay is a real social hotspot. Teenagers come from all over to indulge in shopping sprees they can't afford and gorge themselves on fast food with dubious health standards. I say this all as a compliment, of course. Stay here, and you won't have to walk through the city for ages just to get a good taco. As for the apartment quality, you can rest assured that it is definitely an apartment.",
    "poudrinalley": "You know, people point to the labrynthine building structure and the morbid levels of graffiti and say this place is a wreck. I don't think so, though. Graffiti is art, and unlike many districts in NLACakaNM, the densely packed cityscape makes it difficult to get shot through your window. The 7-11's right around the corner, to boot. For that, I'd say we're charging a real bargain.",
    "greenlightdistrict": "Did you just win the lottery? Have you recently made spending decisions that alientated you from your family? Are you TFAAAP? Then the Green Light District Triple Seven Apartments are for you! Gamble, drink, and do whatever they do in brothels to your heart's content, all far beyond the judging eyes of society! Just remember, with rent this high, you should enjoy those luxuries while they last...",
    "oldnewyonkers": "Eh? I guess you must've liked the view outside. I can't blame you. It's a peaceful sight out there. Lots of old folks who just want to live far away from the gang violence and close to people they can understand. They might say some racist shit while you're not looking, but getting called a bustah never hurt anybody. Wait, shit. Don't tell my boss I said the B word. Shit. OK, how about this? We normally charge this property higher, but here's a discount.",
    "littlechernobyl": "You're an adventurous one, choosing the good ol' LC. The place is full of ruins and irradiated to hell. A friend of mine once walked into the place, scrawny and pathetic, and walked out a griseled man, full of testosterone and ready to wrestle another crazed mutant. Of course, his hair had fallen out, but never mind that. I'm sure your stay will be just as exciting. Just sign on the dotted line.",
    "arsonbrook": "Oh, Arsonbrook? Hang on, I actually need to check if that one's available. You know how it is. We have to make sure we're not selling any torched buildings to our customers. I realize how that sounds, but owning an apartment in Arsonbrook is easier than you think. Once you're settled in with a fire extinguisher or three, the local troublemakers will probably start going for emptier flats. And even if your house does get burned down, it'll be one hell of a story.",
    "astatineheights": "If you live with the yuppies in Astatine Heights, people will treat you like a god. When you walk by on the street, they'll say: \"Oh wow! I can't believe such a rich Juvie is able to tolerate my presence! I must fellate him now, such that my breathing is accepted in their presence!\" It has amazing garage space and a walk-in fridge. Trust me, the mere sight of it would make a communist keel over in disgusted envy.",
    "gatlingsdale": "You'll be living above a bookstore, it looks like. We'd have a normal apartment complex set up, but these pretentious small businesses refuse to sell their property. Guess you'll have to settle for living in some hipster's wet dream for now. We are working to resolve the inconvenience as soon as we can. On the upside, you have every liberty to shout loudly below them and disrupt their quiet reading enviornment.",
    "vandalpark": "Did you know that the apartment complex we have for lease was once lived in by the famous Squickey Henderson? That guy hit like 297 home runs in his career, and you better believe he picked up his bat skills from gang violence. What I'm telling you is, if you buy property here, then you're on your way to the major leagues, probably! Besides, the apartment is actually pretty well built.",
    "glocksbury": "There are a lot of police here. I can see the frothing rage in your eyes already, but hear me out. If you want to go do the gang violence, or whatever you kids do these days, then you can go over someplace else and do it there. Then, when you come back, your poudrins and dire apples will still be unstolen. I suppose that still means you're living around cops all the time, but for this price, that may be an atrocity you have to endure.",
    "northsleezeborough": "This place may as well be called Land of the Doomers, for as lively as the citizens are. They're disenfranchised, depressed, and probably voted for Gary Johnson. My suggestion is not to avoid them like the plague. Instead, I think you really ought to liven up their lives a little. Seriously, here you have a group of un-harassed people just waiting for their lives to go from bad to worse! I think a juvenile delinquent like yourself would be right at home. Wait, is that incitement? Forget what I just said.",
    "southsleezeborough": "Ah, I see. Yes, I was a weeb once, too. I always wanted to go to the place where anime is real and everyone can buy swords. Even if the streets smell like fish, the atmosphere is unforgettable. And with this apartment, the place actually reflects that culture. The doors are all sliding, the bathroom is Japanese-style, and your window overlooks to a picturesque view of the Dojo.",
    "oozegardens": "This place has such a lovely counterculture. Everybody makes the community beautiful with their vibrant gardens, and during the night they celebrate their unity with PCP and drum circles. Everybody fucks everybody, and they all have Digibro-level unkempt beards. If you're willing to put gang violence aside and smell the flowers, you'll quickly find your neighbors will become your family. Of course, we all know you're unwilling to do that, so do your best to avoid killing the damn dirty hippies, OK?",
    "cratersville": "OK...what to say about Cratersville? It's cheap, for one. You're not going to get a better deal on housing anywhere else. It's... It has a fridge, and a closet, and everything! I'm pretty sure there aren't holes in any of those objects, either, at least not when you get them. What else? I guess it has less gang violence than Downtown, and cleaner air than Smogsburg. Actually, fuck it. This place sucks. Just buy the property already. ",
    "wreckington": "So you want to eat a lot of really good pancakes. And you also want to live in a place that looks like war-torn Syria. But unfortunately, you can't do both at the same time. Well boy howdy, do I have a solution for you! Wreckington is world famous for its abandoned and demolished properties and its amazing homestyle diner. More than one apartment complex has actually been demolished with people still in it! How's that for a life-enhancing risk?",
    "slimesend": "I like to imagine retiring in Slime's End. To wake up to the sound of gulls and seafoam, to walk out into the sun and lie under a tree for the rest my days, doesn't it sound perfect? Then, when my old age finally creeps up on me, I can just walk off the cliff and skip all those tearful goodbyes at the very end. Er...right, the apartment. It's pretty good,  a nice view. I know you're not quite retiring age, but I'm sure you'll get there.",
    "vagrantscorner": "Hmm. I've never actually been to Vagrant's Corner. And all it says on this description is that it has a lot of pirates. Pirates are pretty cool, though. Like, remember that time when Luffy had Rob Lucci in the tower, and he Gum Gum Gatling-ed the living shit out of him and broke the building? That was sick, dude. OK, Google is telling me that there's a pretty good bar there, so I suppose that would be a perk, too.",
    "assaultflatsbeach": "Sure, the flat has massive storage space in all aspects. Sure, you can ride a blimp to work if you feel like it. Sure, it's the very definition of \"beachhouse on the waterfront\". But do you REALLY know why this is a top piece of real estate? Dinosaurs. They're huge, they attack people, they're just an all around riot. If you catch some of the ones here and sell them to paleontologists, this place will pay itself back in no time.",
    "newnewyonkers": "Let's be real for a second: I don't need to tell you why New New Yonkers is amazing. They have basically everything there: bowling, lazer tag, arcades, if it distracts adolescents, they have it. Don't let the disgusting old people tell you otherwise: this place is only going up from here. Sure, we had to skimp out a bit on the structural integrity of the place, but surely that won't be noticed until vandals eventually start trying to break it down.",
    "brawlden": "Brawlden's not too scary to live in, relatively speaking. Maybe you'll get pummeled by a straggling dad if you look at him funny, but chances are he won't kill you. If the lanky fellows down at N.L.A.C.U. Labs are able to live in Brawlden, I'm sure you can too. And think of the money you're saving! A \"quality\" apartment, complete with the best mini-fridge and cupboard this side of the city!",
    "toxington": "Are you really considering living in a place that's completely overrun with deadly gases? It's called TOXINGTON, you idiot! The few people who live there now are miners whose brains were already poisoned into obsolescence. I know we technically sell it as a property, but come on, man! You have so much to live for! Call a suicide hotline or get a therapist or something. Anything but this.",
    "charcoalpark": "It's a po-dunk place with po-dunk people. That is to say, it doesn't matter. Charcoal Park is the equivalent of a flyover state, but its location on the edge of the map prevents even that utility. That's exactly why it's perfect for a juvie like yourself. If you want to go into hiding, I personally guarantee the cops will never find you. Of course, you may end up assimilating with the uninspired fucks that live there, but I think that it still fills a niche here in our fair city.",
    "poloniumhill": "If you live with the wannabes in Polonium Hill, people will treat you like a dog. When you walk by on the street, they'll say: \"Oh damn! I can't believe such a desperate Juvie is able to go on living! I must slit their throat just to put 'em out of their misery!\" It nonetheless has amazing storage space and a big, gaudy-looking fridge. Trust me, the mere sight of it would make a communist keel over from the abject waste of material goods. I'm just being honest, buddy. Go live in Astatine Heights instead.",
    "westglocksbury": "If you ever wanted to turn killing people into a reality show, this is probably where you'd film it. The cops were stationed in Glocksbury in order to deal with this place, but they don't tread here for the same reason most of us don't. The corpses here get mangled. I've seen ripped out spines, chainsaw wounds, and other Mortal Kombat-like lacerations. Our photographer couldn't even take a picture of the property without getting a severed leg in the shot. But, as a delinquent yourself, I imagine that could also be a good thing.",
    "jaywalkerplain": "Are you one of those NMU students? Or maybe you're after the drug culture. Well in either case, Jaywalker Plain's an excellent place to ruin your life. In addition to having lots of like-minded enablers, the countless parks will give you the perfect spot to pace and ruminate on your decisions. You know, this is a sales pitch. I probably shouldn't make the place sound so shitty.",
    "crookline": "Now, we've gotten a lot of complaints about thieves here, stealing our clients' SlimeCoin wallets and relieving them of our rent money. We acknowledge this is a problem, so for every purchase of a property in Crookline, we've included this anti-thievery metal codpiece. Similar to how a chastity belt blocks sexual urges, this covers your pockets, making you invulnerable to petty thieves. Apart from that perk, in Crookline you'll get a lovely high-rise flat with all the essentials, all coated in a neat gloomy neon aesthetic.",
    "dreadford": "Have you ever wanted to suck on the sweet, sweet teat of ultra-decadence? Do you have multiple yachts? Do you buy both versions of Pokemon when they come out, just because you can blow the cash? Ha. Let me introduce you to the next level of opulence. Each apartment is a full-scale mansion, maintained by some of the finest slimebutlers in the industry. In the morning they tickle your feet to get you up, and at night they sing you Sixten ballads to drift you back to restful slumber. The place is bulletproof, fireproof, and doubles as a nuclear bunker if things go south. And it stores...everything. The price, you say? Shit, I was hoping you wouldn't ask.",
    "maimridge": "Perhaps you think it's sketchy that we're selling lightly refurbished log cabins built eons ago. Well let me ask you something, young juvie: do you like getting laid? Well, living in Maimridge is your ticket into ice-cold lust and debauchery. You just bring a lady friend or whoever into your isolated mountain cabin, and our state-of-the-art faulty electrical wiring will leave you stranded and huddling for warmth in no time flat! Wow...I'm picturing you now. Yeah, you definitely want this one."

They can heal any Gaiaslimeoid within range, but will prioritize those that are low on health, saving Pulp Gourds for last.\nBlood Cabbage\'s obsession with the dark arts led her down an equally dark path in life.

If a Steel Bean is damaged, you can !plant another one on top of it to repair it. It cannot be given a Joybean.\nSteel Bean is the middle child of the Metal Crop Bros. He has a deep fascination with conspiracy theories, to the point where his brothers seriously worry about his mental state at times.

He has taken a product of the Garden Gankers and used it against them. This increase in defense compensates for the lack of vision it provides, but to be fair Shamblers don\'t really need to worry about that when their only concern is with moving forward in a straight line.\nhttps://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/743240814250950678/743241134977056858/juveolanternshambler_gravestone.png',

They make use of their springy legs to leap over short distances, and seek out the mouth-watering Garden Gankers hiding behind the less-desireable leafy appendages of all Gaiaslimeoids.
